    "     5) Works with Other Libraries -\n",
    "        Purpose: Many popular Python libraries (like Pandas, SciPy, and TensorFlow) use NumPy arrays.\n",
    "        Advantage: This makes it easier to work with different libraries together, as they share a common data structure.\n",
    "     6. Broadcasting -\n",
    "        Purpose: NumPy allows you to perform operations on arrays of different sizes without needing to reshape them manually.\n",
    "        Advantage: This simplifies calculations and saves time when working with arrays of varying dimensions.\n",

    "Q2) Compare and contrast np.mean() and np.average() functions in NumPy. When would you use one over the other?\n",
    "Answer-\n",
    "    In NumPy, both np.mean() and np.average() are used to calculate the average of an array, but there are key differences between them in \n",
    "    terms of functionality and use cases. Here’s a comparison and explanation of when to use one over the other -\n",
    "    1) Basic Functionality -\n",
    "       np.mean(): This function computes the arithmetic mean (or simple average) of the elements in an array.\n",
    "       np.average(): By default, this function also computes the arithmetic mean, but it allows you to include weights, which means you can \n",
    "       compute a weighted average.\n",
    "    2) Weights Parameter -\n",
    "       np.mean(): Does not support weights. It calculates a simple average without considering any importance or weight of individual\n",
    "       elements.\n",
    "       np.average(): Supports a weights parameter that allows you to assign different weights to elements, making it ideal for calculating \n",
    "       weighted averages.\n",
    "    3) Return Value -\n",
    "       np.mean(): Returns a single scalar value representing the arithmetic mean of all elements.\n",
    "       np.average(): Also returns a scalar when computing the average. However, if you provide weights and specify returned=True, it will \n",
    "       return a tuple containing the average and the sum of the weights.\n",
    "    4) Performance -\n",
    "       np.mean(): Generally faster when you only need a simple average since it doesn’t involve the additional overhead of processing weights.\n",
    "       np.average(): Slightly slower due to the flexibility it offers with weights, even if weights are not used.\n",
    "    5) Use Cases -\n",
    "       Use np.mean() when:\n",
    "       a) You want to compute a simple arithmetic mean of an array.\n",
    "       b) You do not need to consider the importance or weight of individual elements.\n",
    "       c) You are looking for a fast, straightforward average calculation.\n",
    "      Use np.average() when:\n",
    "       a) You need to calculate a weighted average where some elements contribute more to the result than others.\n",

    "       NumPy Arrays - Store elements in a contiguous block of memory with a fixed data type, making memory usage more efficient.\n",

    "Q10) Explain the concepts of vectorization and broadcasting in NumPy. How do they contribute to efficient array operations?\n",
    "Answer-\n",
    "    1) Vectorization in NumPy -\n",
    "       Vectorization refers to the process of applying operations to entire arrays (or vectors) in a single step, without using explicit loops.\n",
    "       In NumPy, this means that operations like addition, multiplication, and other element-wise operations are executed on the entire array\n",
    "       at once. NumPy internally implements these operations in optimized C code, allowing them to run much faster than if you manually looped\n",
    "       through each element in Python.\n",
    "       Vectorization applies operations to entire arrays at once, improving speed and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Benefits of Vectorization:\n",
    "    1) Speed: Vectorized operations are much faster than loops in Python because they eliminate the overhead of Python's interpreted loop \n",
    "       execution and leverage optimized low-level implementations.\n",
    "    2) Cleaner Code: Vectorized operations make the code more concise and easier to read, as the same operation is applied to an entire array\n",
    "       without needing explicit loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Broadcasting in NumPy -\n",
    "       Broadcasting is a mechanism that allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes, by automatically \"stretching\" the \n",
    "       smaller array to match the shape of the larger array. This avoids the need to manually reshape arrays or repeat values, allowing for \n",
    "       efficient operations.\n",
    "       Broadcasting allows arrays of different shapes to be operated on together by automatically expanding the smaller array to match the \n",
    "       shape of the larger array.\n",
    "\n",
    "    How Broadcasting Works:\n",
    "    When performing operations on arrays of different shapes, NumPy compares the shapes element-wise from right to left. If the dimensions \n",
    "    are not the same, NumPy:\n",
    "    1) Tries to \"broadcast\" the smaller array by virtually replicating its data along the missing dimensions.\n",
    "    2) It doesn’t actually copy data, which would be inefficient, but instead performs operations as if the smaller array were expanded.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Rules for Broadcasting:\n",
    "    1) If the dimensions are equal, the arrays are compatible.\n",
    "    2) If one of the arrays has a dimension of size 1, NumPy \"stretches\" this dimension to match the other array.\n",
    "    3) Arrays with incompatible shapes will raise a ValueError.\n",
    "\n",
    "    contribution of Vectorization and Broadcasting to efficient array operations -\n",
    "    1) Avoid Loops: Both vectorization and broadcasting eliminate the need for explicit Python loops, which are slow due to Python’s \n",
    "       interpreted nature. Instead, operations are performed using highly optimized, low-level code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) Speed and Performance: \n",
    "       Vectorized operations are faster because NumPy leverages efficient C-based implementations that work on entire arrays at once.\n",
    "       Broadcasting allows operations on arrays of different shapes without needing to manually reshape or copy data, saving both time and \n",
